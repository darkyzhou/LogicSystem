Premises: p -> ~q, ~r->p, q
Conclusion: r

Proof:

1. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- q  [ prem   ]
2. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- p->~q [prem]
3. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- ~q\/~p [implyToOr 2]
4. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- ~p   [ds 1 3]
5. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- ~r -> p [prem]
6. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- ~~r \/p [implyToOr 5]
7. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- ~~r    [  ds 4 6 ]
8. p -> ~q, ~r->p, q |- r [nne 7]
